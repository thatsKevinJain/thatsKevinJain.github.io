I am a highly driven individual with a love for software engineering. I have worked on a myriad of projects (personal, professional and academic) that involve building both backend and frontend systems.

I have built Android apps for my own real-time GPS tracking startup company that catered 15K+ users in my city Mumbai. Later, I moved on to work at an early-stage startup company as a Backend and DevOps developer where I built APIs and services that scaled to 1M+ active users in India.

Currently, I am a master's student in Computer Science working on my thesis titled "Implications of different CPU architectures on the performance of serverless applications" where I detect bottlenecks in cloud systems and find ways for cloud services providers to improve their serverless offerings. Along with that I am building a game website with the Department of Sociology that revolves around understanding the value of choices of in our lives that affect our individual and collective happiness.

I actively contribute to building open-source tools and libraries and have made most of my projects public on my GitHub.

Collectively, the list of the tools and programming languages that I have worked with so far are - Node.js, Python, C++, SQL, MongoDB, React, Svelte, Three.js, Java, HTML, CSS, Git, Shell, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenWhisk, AWS, GCP.

I love solving problems and self-exploration.
